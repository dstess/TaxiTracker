TaxiTracker
===========

Created by Dave Stess (2014) using Django, Google Maps API, Javascript, MySQL, and a dash of AJAX

--AWS Deployment Coming Soon--

Welcome to Taxi Tracker! There are two sides of the app - one for taxi companies and the other for potential customers.

Here's the company side.

The starting location is the Bay area. I know - I should've named this UberTracker.

On the company side, users can mark an area of service (see rectangle on next screenshot), enter a company name, and submit the coordinates and name to a database. 

The coordinates update in real-time as the rectangle is moved and changed.

For the purposes of this readme, I've submitted the illustrious yet fictional Dave Taxi Co. to the database. 

Now, onto the customer side of the app:

On this side of the app, users can click anywhere on the map and see the companies that serve the selected area (thanks, AJAX).

Enjoy! This is more of a proof-of-concept type of thing. I may build on it in the future if I have time. 

-Dave
